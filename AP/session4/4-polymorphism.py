💡 Polymorphism allows for the use of a common interface for different underlying forms (e.g., different classes), making the code more flexible and easier to extend.

🚀 Use Cases:

➡️ Plug-in Systems: Polymorphism is useful in plug-in architectures where different modules or plug-ins can be used interchangeably, each providing different implementations of the same interface.

➡️ Graphical Applications: In graphics applications, different shapes (e.g., circles, squares) can be handled through a common interface for rendering, even though each shape has its own implementation of drawing.
